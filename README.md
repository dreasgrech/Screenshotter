Recently (2012) I needed a way to take screenshots of applications programmatically in C# and I wrote this small application to accomplish that task for me.

The only requirement I had was that I supply the pId (process ID) and the application takes a screenshot of that process for me...but the application can be very easily extended to accept a process name or anything that can identify a process.
